# DiseasesDatabase
A MySQL database I created and deployed as a solution for DB course (CSCI341) assignment.

## This repository contains two files: create_tables.sql and control.py

### create_tables.sql creates a schema and initializes tables
for different types of entities, including patients, doctors, diseases, 
countries, and so on. There are primary and secondary keys, and other things.

### control.py is the file that contains SQLAlchemy and pure SQL queries
that I made to retrieve specific information from the database. There
are 11 queries that retrieve lots of information.
